## 1. GitHub Commits
Include a screenshot showing commits of all team members.

## 2. List of Tasks
For each student in the group, state what parts they contributed to. For example "Steven did 50% of the Network Design, 90% of the security assessment and reviewed the ethical and social issues.". Using a table is recommended, but not required.

## 3. Reflection on Commits and Tasks
Reflect on GitHub commits, tasks performed and which weeks commits were made. See Project Specification for detailed requirements. 
Our team collaborated consistently using the following tools:
- **GitHub**: To manage version control, share markdown files, and collaborate on Excel templates
- **Microsoft Teams / Messenger**: For quick discussion and coordination
- **Zoom / In-person meetings**: For planning milestones and presentation

We held regular progress checks twice a week to discuss task status, review issues, and assign responsibilities. Deadlines were tracked using GitHub issues and milestone features.

**What worked well:**
- GitHub helped us stay synced and manage updates efficiently
- Open communication and respectful feedback helped improve the quality of work
- Sharing small deliverables weekly kept the project on track

**What didnâ€™t work well:**
- Initially, some team members were unfamiliar with Markdown formatting and Git
- Time zone differences and class schedules made scheduling meetings difficult
- Some documents (like the risk assessment sheet) were time-consuming to agree on


## 4. Reflection on Group Work
Discuss how you worked in a group, issues encountered and recommended techniques for future. See Project Specification for detailed requirements.
To improve collaboration and workflow in future projects, we suggest the following:

- Use a **shared team Kanban board** (e.g., Trello or GitHub Projects) to visually track progress and deadlines
- Allocate buffer time for reviews before submission dates
- Conduct a **quick upskilling session** at the start to familiarize all team members with Git and Markdown
- Assign a **communication lead** to ensure consistent updates and meeting reminders

Overall, we successfully worked as a team, learned from one another, and completed all deliverables on time. This project helped us strengthen our teamwork, technical, and communication skills in a real-world collaborative environment.
